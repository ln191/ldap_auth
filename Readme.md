## Playbook

## Files that will be change 

| File                  |   Description                             |   Permission     |
| ----                  |   -----------                             |   ----------     |
|   /etc/ldap.conf      | Setting for ldap connects and search.     | root:root 0644   |
|   /etc/pam.d/common-account | Login Account settings              | root:root 0644   |
|   /etc/pam.d/common-auth    | Login Auth settings                 | root:root 0644   |



## LDAP conf

When ldap client has been install on the linux machine, generated a /etc/ldap.conf with the setting given in the setup process,

This here we control how the ldap server is accesed and what fliters to use when searching the ldap server.

## PAM ( Pluggable authentication module )

Authentecation in linux is control by PAM, when you install ldap client it also install a ldap pam module, and apply it to the PAM configs.

this allows both ldap and local users to login on the server.

The pam configs is found at /etc/pam.d directory. the common files is the base files and is include in the other config files.
There is a config file for each service needing auth, like sshd, login(unix login). osv
so to apply ldap auth to all service we change the commen files.

If you only want a spesific group of ldap to login, you need to change the pam config files, otherwise you will not be able to login with local users.

reset chache    sudo nscd --invalidate=hosts
restart       sudo /etc/init.d/nscd restartÂ´   ||    service nscd restart
